ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m @LewisN3142 ðŸ‘‹

I'm a mathematics PhD student studying the properties of systems of differential equations through induced geometric structures on their phase space. 
In particular, I am interested in the (higher) symplectic geometry associated with systems of Jacobi/Monge--Amp{\`e}re type equations which arise in, for example, fluid dynamical flows.

This account will house some of the programming projects I work on in my spare time. 
I have a small amount of experience with a variety of programming languages and software, including Python, Matlab, Mathematica, and C++.
At the moment I am practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript working on a personal portfolio website to showcase my research, programming, and artwork.

If you have an interesting project idea you would like to collaborate on, especially anything regarding visualising complex geometry or game/mod development, please do let me know.
At present I am most easily contacted via: lewis.napper@surrey.ac.uk

(At some stage this contact method will be replaced, perhaps with a form or with a dedicated repo TBC)
