ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m @LewisN3142 ðŸ‘‹

I'm a mathematics PhD student studying the properties of systems of differential equations through induced geometric structures on their phase space. 
In particular, I am interested in the (higher) symplectic geometry associated with systems of Jacobi/Monge--Amp`ere type equations which arise in, for example, fluid dynamical flows. In parallel to this, I also investigate so-called synthetic Lorentzian geometry and the framework of Lorentzian length spaces which allow for the modelling of low regularity generalisations of space-time.

This account will house some of the programming projects I work on in my spare time. 
I have experience with a variety of programming languages and software, including Python, Matlab, Mathematica, and C++.
At the moment I am practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript working on a personal [portfolio website](https://lewisn3142.github.io/) to showcase my research, programming, and artwork, as well as improving my C++ skills by developing the [Cellular Automata Engine](https://github.com/LewisN3142/CellularAutomataEngine)

If you have an interesting project idea you would like to collaborate on, especially anything regarding visualising complex geometry or game/mod development, please do let me know.
At present I am most easily contacted by one of the following methods
 - via email at lewis.napper@surrey.ac.uk 
 - via the contact form found at https://lewisn3142.github.io/contact_page/contact.html
 - for project specific concerns, by raising an issue on the appropriate project
